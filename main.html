	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of how efficient and how long it takes to run an algorithm, 
		based on the size of the input.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the amount of memory an algorithm uses to solve a problem. It's a measure of how much space an algorithm needs to grow as the input data increases O(n).</p>
